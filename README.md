## How to use

* 1 _customer create type of ramen to send to kitchen to make_ 
* 2 _Cook took the order and start making ramen, after ramen is done, cook will click on the made and serve to move ramen to wai stuff session_
* 3 _wait staff can return the order by clicking make again to have cook make the ramen again_

## Future Development

1. allow cook account so that order taken by certain cook will be stamped with cook's name
2. Added menu item to select instead of manually enter ramen names.
3. Add a server pick up button so when this button is clicked, the order will be archived.
